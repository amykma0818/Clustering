# K-means clustering
In a machine learning interview setting, you might be asked how the output from K-means clustering might be used to assess its performance as the best algorithm.

In this exercise you'll practice K-means clustering. Using the `.inertia_` attribute to compare models with different numbers of clusters, `k`, you'll then also use this information to assess cluster number in the next exercise.

Recall that the target variable in the `diabetes` dataset is `progression`.
